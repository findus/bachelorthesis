\chapter*{Abstract}

Espacialy when talking about shooters the debate about violent contents of computer games gets a really hot topic.
Science is used by opponents of such games as evidence that they cause negative effect to the players, as well as by the
opponents to proof such a negative effect doesn't exist. The question how games would look like without these
illustrations of violence is rarely asked. That lack of consideration is adressed by this thesis. It examines the genre
in detail and presents a concept for the development of a tactical multiplayer shooter without any violent content. Some
elements of popular games will be combined with with new ideas, e.g. replacing the depiction of weapons and murder
without the fun of the game getting lost.
